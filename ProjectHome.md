**PirateBayWatch**
This is something i wrote in when i found myself repeatedly visiting the piratebay and searching for certain movies and tv episodes. This piece of software now keeps a list of what i am looking for and notifies me when a hit is availible or reaches a certain amount of seeders or leechers. There are direct links to the torrents and detail pages.

**Technical note:** This is written in VB.NET and therefore only runs on windows machines. You will need the .NET Framework 2.0 or newer. This is preinstalled on all Vista machines and many XP machines, if you dont have it you will be asked to download it upon installation.

**Disclaimer:** I dont encourage sharing of copyrighted material if it is breaking the law in your particular country, this software is intended to be used for legal purposes only. This piece of software only communicates with thepiratebay via regular http requests, as if you were surfing the site as usually and is in itself not illegal in any way.
